  - danpost (Greenfoot user). I followed their 'Everything Scrolling' tutorial and used the included 'constant scrolling' code to create the continuously scrolling                                     background, giving the illusion that the spaceship is moving.
  - Nossan1459 (Greenfoot user). I used code from their basic recreation of the game 'Space Invaders' to get all the actors that consisted of each alien stage to move                                    simultaneously/stay in sync. 
  - robale (Greenfoot user). I took great inspiration from their own recreation of Galaga. In the early stages of this project, there were times where I wasn't sure how                              to start. Looking at how this individual organized and constructed different things in their game really helped me.

For my final project, I decided to (attempt to) re-create the classic arcade shooter game, Galaga! The controls are pretty straightforward: use left and right arrow keys to control horizontal movement, and the spacebar to fire lasers from your spaceship. I would like to once again thank all of the individuals listed above for making this project possible.
